      GPA: 3.51/4.3
      
      My undergraduate education in Electrical Engineering provided me with a solid foundation in both engineering and theoretical concepts. My primary concentration was in control theory, while I also explored various other fields. Without doubt, deep learning is also one of such fields which naturally builds on the mathematical and signal-processing foundations of my EE training.

I am an M.S. student in Electrical Engineering at **Columbia University**, advised by [Prof. Zoran Kostić](https://www.aidl.ee.columbia.edu/) and working closely with [Prof. Chengzhi Mao](https://chengzhi-mao.github.io/). My research centers on **reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs)**, with a focus on *self-improving training pipelines*, *reward design*, and *reinforcement-learning–based post-training*. My broader goal is to build **trustworthy, sample-efficient multimodal systems** that can operate reliably in complex real-world environments. And this remains a serious and unsolved topic—one that demands sustained effort from myself, and the broader research community.

Prior to Columbia, I received my B.S. in **Automation and Control** from **Xi’an Jiaotong University** in 2024. My background in control theory and signal processing continues to shape my current work—especially in optimization dynamics, stability, and information-efficient learning—forming a coherent trajectory toward **advanced multimodal AI**.

I am currently preparing **Ph.D. applications for Fall 2026**, aiming to develop the next generation of *robust and verifiable multimodal reasoning models*.
