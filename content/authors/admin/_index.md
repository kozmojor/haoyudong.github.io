I am an M.S. student in Electrical Engineering at **Columbia University**, advised by [Prof. Zoran Kostić](https://www.aidl.ee.columbia.edu/) and working closely with [Prof. Chengzhi Mao](https://chengzhi-mao.github.io/). My research focuses on **reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs)**, with an emphasis on self-improving models, reward design, and reinforcement-learning–based post-training.

Prior to Columbia, I received my B.S. degree in **Automation and Control** from **Xi’an Jiaotong University** in July 2024. __I am currently preparing applications for **Ph.D. programs starting in Fall 2026**, with the goal of developing reliable and sample-efficient multimodal reasoning systems.__
