I won A+ grade in **ECBM4040 NEURAL NETWRKS & DEEP LEARNING** advised by **Prof.Zoran Kostic** in Columbia. 

Exploring deep learning has been an enriching experience, offering valuable insights and practical applications as I built different models from scratch. Throughout the course, I had the opportunity to work on various challenges, including a Kaggle competition on CNN image classification, where I achieved a **top-three** accuracy in the class. I also received a score of **95/100** on my final project, which further deepened my understanding of the subject. Ultimately, I completed the course with an **A+**, and Iâ€™m excited to continue exploring this dynamic field.

My final project is about **Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem based Neural Network**, and the final report is available [**here**](E4040.2024Fall.KANY.report.hd2573.jx2598.yk3108.pdf) while code is in my [**github**](https://github.com/kozmojor/Tensorflow-Implementation-of-KAN).
