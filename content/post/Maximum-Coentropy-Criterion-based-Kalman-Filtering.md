This project is the thesis for my B.S degree in Control & Automation in Xian Jiaotong University, advised by **Prof.Guanghua Zhang**. The work is mainly about the improvement of **Traditional Kalman Filter(KF)** under **Non-Gaussian noise**. In the project, two kinds of non-gaussian noise are introduced as example: Mixture Gaussian Noise & Shot Noise, and Maximum Coentropy Criterion serves as the core of improved KF(MCCKF). Both mathematical derivation & coding experiments show the outstanding performance of MCCKF under given noises compared with classical KF. The Chinese version of the paper can be found [**here**](Maximum-Coentropy-Criterion-based-Kalman-Filtering.pdf).
